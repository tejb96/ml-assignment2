The trainning score remained 0.93, but the validation score increased by 0.01 when the small data was used. The difference between the training score and the validation score is 0.005 for the small data model, and 0.018 for the full data model, which means there is more bias in the small data model. The model fitted to the first two columns of X showed a significant decrease in performace compared to the other two datasets. The data used was to less for the model to learn from, and if there was noise, that may be cause the performance to drop as well.\n",

Since this model is based on emails being marked as spam, a false positive represents an email that is not spam being sent to the spam folder and a false negaive represents an email that is spam not being marked as such.

    "Based on the R2 values, the model produced fairly good results. With accuracies of approximately 61% for the training data and 62% for the validation data. The performance was better for the validation data, however it was not that far off from the performance for the training data. The mean square error is 111 for the training data and 96 for validation, and a greater value generally indicates that the model was not a good fit. This could however also be caused by numerical discrepencies, such as when the head of the data was printed, the column containing the age increased from 28 at index 0 to 360 at index 4. Although, in this case it might be that this model was not a good fit because the first sentence on the website provided in step 1 says that concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear funciton."
